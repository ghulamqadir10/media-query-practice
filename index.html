    <p class="climate">
      The Earth’s climate is changing and the global climate is projected to
      continue to change over this century and beyond. The magnitude of climate
      change beyond the next few decades will depend primarily on the amount of
      greenhouse (heat-trapping) gases emitted globally and on the remaining
      uncertainty in the sensitivity of the Earth’s climate to those emissions.
      With significant reductions in the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs),
      global annual averaged temperature rise could be limited to 2°C or less.
      However, without major reductions in these emissions, the increase in
      annual average global temperatures, relative to preindustrial times, could
      reach 5°C or more by the end of this century. The global climate continues
      to change rapidly compared to the pace of the natural variations in
      climate that have occurred throughout Earth’s history. Trends in globally
      averaged temperature, sea level rise, upper-ocean heat content, land-based
      ice melt, arctic sea ice, depth of seasonal permafrost thaw, and other
      climate variables provide consistent evidence of a warming planet. These
      observed trends are robust and confirmed by multiple, independent research
      groups around the world. Figure 1 shows global average temperature
      anomalies; since the 1880s global average temperature has warmed
      approximately 1°C. Figure 1. Global Average Temperature Anomalies,
      departure from 1881-1910. The plot shows how much global annual average
      temperatures for the years 1880-2022 have been above or below the
      1881-1910 average. Temperatures for years warmer than the early industrial
      baseline are shown in red; temperatures for years cooler than the baseline
      are shown in purple. Graphic: Climate Central; Data: NASA GISS and NOAA
      NCEI. global temperature anomalies averaged and adjusted to early
      industrial baseline (1881-1910). Data as of 1/12/2023 Observations of the
      climate system are based on direct physical and biogeochemical
      measurements, and remote sensing from ground stations and satellites.
      Information derived from paleoclimate archives provides a long-term
      context of past climates. Different types of environmental evidence are
      used to understand what the Earth’s past climate was like and why. Records
      of historical climate conditions are preserved in tree rings, locked in
      the skeletons of tropical coral reefs, sealed in glaciers and ice caps,
      and buried in laminated sediments from lakes and the ocean. Scientists can
      use those environmental recorders to estimate past conditions, extending
      our understanding of climate back hundreds to millions of years.
      Global-scale observations from the instrumental era began in the mid-19th
      century, and paleoclimate reconstructions extend the record of some
      quantities back hundreds to millions of years. Together, this provides a
      comprehensive view of the variability and long-term changes in the
      atmosphere, the ocean, the cryosphere and at the land surface.
      Paleoclimate Reconstructions from paleoclimate archives allow current
      changes in atmospheric composition, sea level and climate systems
      (including extreme events such as droughts and floods), as well as
      projections of future climates, to be placed in a broader perspective of
      past climate variability. Past climate information also documents the
      behavior of slow components of the climate system including the carbon
      cycle, ice sheets and the deep ocean for which instrumental records are
      short compared to their characteristic time scales of responses to
      perturbations, thus informing on mechanisms of abrupt and irreversible
      changes. Climate records over past centuries and millennia indicate that
      average temperatures in recent decades over much of the world have been
      much higher, and have risen faster during this time period, than at any
      time for which the historical global distribution of surface temperatures
      can be reconstructed. Paleoclimate can help us understand climate change
      on a geological timescale rather than a few human generations. Figure 2
      presents paleoclimate reconstruction for the Northern Hemisphere(NH),
      which reveals average annual temperatures, for the period 1983–2012 was
      very likely the warmest 30-year period of the last 800 years and likely
      the warmest 30-year period of the last 1400 years. a) shows the radiative
      forcing due to volcanic, solar and well-mixed greenhouse gases (WMGHGs).
      Different colors illustrate the two existing data sets for volcanic
      forcing and four estimates of solar forcing and the grey line represents
      WMGHGs for the period 850-2000. b) represents the simulated (red) and
      reconstructed (shading) Northern Hemisphere temperature anomalies. The
      thick red line depicts the multi-model mean while the thin red lines show
      the multi-model 90% range. The overlap of reconstructed temperatures is
      shown by grey shading. Figure 2. a) Radiative forcing (W/m2) due to
      volcanic, solar and well-mixed greenhouse gases for the period 850-2000.
      b) Reconstructed (grey) and simulated (red) Northern Hemisphere
      Temperature Anomalies for the period 850-2000. Model projections (Figure
      3) indicate that twenty-first century global average warming will
      substantially exceed the Last Glacial Maximum period and even the warmest
      Holocene conditions; producing a climate state not previously experienced.
      Figure 3. Model-simulated global temperature anomalies for the Last
      Glacial Maximum (21,000 years ago), the mid-Holocene (6,000 years ago),
      and projection for 2071–2095, under RCP8.5 What this means Earth’s climate
      is now changing faster than at any point in the known history of the
      climate, primarily as a result of human activities. There is scientific
      consensus that unmitigated carbon emissions will lead to global warming of
      at least several degrees Celsius by 2100, resulting in high-impacts of
      local, regional and global risks to human society and natural ecosystems.
      Global climate change has already resulted in a wide range of impacts
      across every region of the earth as well as many economic sectors. Impacts
      related to climate change are evident across regions and in many sectors
      important to society, such as human health, agriculture and food security,
      water supply, transportation, energy, and biodiversity and ecosystems;
      impacts are expected to become increasingly disruptive in the coming
      decades. There is very high confidence that the frequency and intensity of
      extreme heat and heavy precipitation events are increasing in most
      continental regions of the world. These trends are consistent with
      expected physical responses to a warming climate. The frequency and
      intensity of extreme high temperature events are virtually certain to
      increase in the future as global temperature increases. There is high
      confidence that extreme precipitation events will very likely continue to
      increase in frequency and intensity throughout most of the world. Observed
      and projected trends for other types of extreme events, such as floods,
      droughts, and severe storms, have more variable regional characteristics.
      What is Climate Change Observed changes over the 20th century include
      increases in global air and ocean temperature, rising global sea levels,
      long-term sustained widespread reduction of snow and ice cover, and
      changes in atmospheric and ocean circulation as well as regional weather
      patterns, which influence seasonal rainfall conditions. These changes are
      caused by extra heat in the climate system due to the addition of
      greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. These additional greenhouse gases are
      primarily input by human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels
      (coal, oil, and natural gas), deforestation, agriculture, and land-use
      changes. These activities increase the amount of ‘heat-trapping’
      greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The pattern of observed changes in the
      climate system is consistent with an increased greenhouse effect. Other
      climatic influences such as volcanoes, the sun and natural variability
      cannot alone explain the timing and extent of the observed changes.
      Climate, refers to the long-term regional or global average of
      temperature, humidity and rainfall patterns over seasons, years or
      decades. While the weather can change in just a few hours, climate changes
      over longer timeframes. Climate change is the significant variation of
      average weather conditions becoming, for example, warmer, wetter, or
      drier—over several decades or longer. It is the longer-term trend that
      differentiates climate change from natural weather variability. Human
      activity leads to change in the atmospheric composition either directly
      (via emissions of gases or particles) or indirectly (via atmospheric
      chemistry). Anthropogenic emissions have driven the changes in WMGHG
      concentrations during the Industrial Era. Radiative forcing (RF) is a
      measure of the net change in the energy balance of the Earth system in
      response to some external perturbation; positive RF leads to a warming and
      negative RF to a cooling. The RF concept is valuable for comparing the
      influence on global mean surface temperature of most individual agents
      affecting the Earth’s radiation balance. Figure 4 shows the Radiative
      Forcing and Effective Radiative Forcing (ERF), by concentration change,
      between 1750 and 2011, with associated uncertainty range. Figure 4.
      Radiative Forcing (RF) and Effective Radiative Forcing (ERF) of climate
      change during the Industrial Era, 1750-2011. Solid bars are ERF, hatched
      bars are RF, green diamonds and associated uncertainties are for RF.
      Figure 5. Total annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
      (gigatonne of CO2-equivalent per year, GtCO2-eq/yr) for the period 1970 to
      2010, by gases. Figure 5. The graph shows human-caused emissions over time
      for individual greenhouse gases. Carbon dioxide (CO2) from fossil fuel use
      and industry is the single largest contributor to total emissions at 64%,
      while CO2 from land use change and forestry accounts for 11% and methane
      (CH4) contributes 18%. Source, IPCC Working Group III, 2022. The Coupled
      Model Intercomparison Projects (CMIPs) Understanding our current and
      future climate are questions that are too large and too complex to be
      tackled by a single country, agency or scientific discipline. Through
      international scientific cooperation and partnerships, the World Climate
      Research Program (WCRP) supports the coordination of partners and modeling
      groups participating in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Projects, or
      CMIPs. the CMIPs advance our understanding of the multi-scale dynamic
      interactions between natural and social systems that affect climate. Over
      time, as participation in CMIP increased and the number and complexity of
      climate models expanded, the need for increasingly detailed and organized
      experiments led to CMIP becoming an integrated framework within which a
      number of individual Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) are organized.
      MIPs are sets of experiments and simulations designed to test and compare
      specific aspects of climate models. Each individual MIP lays out an
      experimental design aimed at improving understanding of: important
      physical processes in the climate system; or the response of the climate
      system to external drivers (such as increasing greenhouse gases). The
      climate science community relies on models to understand the Earth’s
      carbon cycle feedbacks in response to anthropogenic emissions, which lead
      to changes in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosol,
      and thus ultimately result in radiative forcings that drive the climate
      system changes. The CMIPs provide a coordinating framework for these
      studies by defining a suite of model experiments for coupled
      atmosphere-ocean general circulation and Earth system models. Next to more
      process-oriented studies, one suite of experiments under CMIP is always
      focused on the climate response to different plausible future societal
      development storylines and associated contrasting emission pathways
      (scenarios). The goal of these ‘scenarios’ is to outline how future
      emissions and land use changes could translate into responses in the
      climate system. While independent of the regularly produced IPCC-UNFCCC
      Assessment Reports, CMIP results nevertheless are coordinated and directly
      inform the Assessments. CMIP phase 5 (CMIP5) provided the foundation for
      the 5th Assessment Report released in 2013 and 2014, and the 6th
      Assessment Report released in 2021 and 2022, is drawing from CMIP6, the
      latest collection of simulations done by the climate science community
      around the world. Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6)
      The Sixth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6)
      comprises 23 individual MIPs. Future climate change simulations are
      coordinated within ‘ScenarioMIP’ for which approximately 30 climate models
      contributed results. Additionally, the Diagnostic, Evaluation and
      Characterization of Klima (DECK) experiments are central to CMIP6 as they
      involve the historical simulations (1850–near present) that allow
      evaluation of the model’s simulation of past climate. While MIPs are given
      priority by CMIP, and organizations can participate in as many or few as
      they are able, the DECK experiments are mandatory for any model to enter
      into the CMIP. Figure 6 illustrates the complex and interconnected nature
      of CMIP6.

    <h2 class="head2">education system</h1>
    <p class="edu">
      It is mandated in the Constitution of Pakistan to provide free and
      compulsory education to all children between the ages of 5-16 years and
      enhance adult literacy. With the 18th constitutional amendment the
      concurrent list which comprised of 47 subjects was abolished and these
      subjects, including education, were transferred to federating units as a
      move towards provincial autonomy. The year 2015 is important in the
      context that it marks the deadline for the participants of Dakar
      declaration (Education For All [EFA] commitment) including Pakistan.
      Education related statistics coupled with Pakistan’s progress regarding
      education targets set in Vision 2030 and Pakistan’s lagging behind in
      achieving EFA targets and its Millennium Development Goals(MDGs) for
      education call for an analysis of the education system of Pakistan and to
      look into the issues and problems it is facing so that workable solutions
      could be recommended. What is Education System? The system of education
      includes all institutions that are involved in delivering formal education
      (public and private, for-profit and nonprofit, onsite or virtual
      instruction) and their faculties, students, physical infrastructure,
      resources and rules. In a broader definition the system also includes the
      institutions that are directly involved in financing, managing, operating
      or regulating such institutions (like government ministries and regulatory
      bodies, central testing organizations, textbook boards and accreditation
      boards). The rules and regulations that guide the individual and
      institutional interactions within the set up are also part of the
      education system. Education system of Pakistan: The education system of
      Pakistan is comprised of 260,903 institutions and is facilitating
      41,018,384 students with the help of 1,535,461 teachers. The system
      includes 180,846 public institutions and 80,057 private institutions.
      Hence 31% educational institutes are run by private sector while 69% are
      public institutes. Analysis of education system in Pakistan Pakistan has
      expressed its commitment to promote education and literacy in the country
      by education policies at domestic level and getting involved into
      international commitments on education. In this regard national education
      policies are the visions which suggest strategies to increase literacy
      rate, capacity building, and enhance facilities in the schools and
      educational institutes. MDGs and EFA programmes are global commitments of
      Pakistan for the promotion of literacy. A review of the education system
      of Pakistan suggests that there has been little change in Pakistan’s
      schools since 2010, when the 18th Amendment enshrined education as a
      fundamental human right in the constitution. Problems of access, quality,
      infrastructure and inequality of opportunity, remain endemic. Issues A)
      MDGs and Pakistan Due to the problems in education system of Pakistan, the
      country is lagging behind in achieving its MDGs of education. The MDGs
      have laid down two goals for education sector: Goal 2: The goal 2 of MDGs
      is to achieve Universal Primary Education (UPE) and by 2015, children
      everywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course
      of primary schooling. By the year 2014 the enrolment statistics show an
      increase in the enrolment of students of the age of 3-16 year while
      dropout rate decreased. But the need for increasing enrolment of students
      remains high to achieve MDGs target. Punjab is leading province wise in
      net primary enrolment rate with 62% enrolment. The enrolment rate in Sindh
      province is 52%, in Khyber Pakhtunkhawa (KPK) 54% and primary enrolment
      rate in Balochistan is 45%. Goal 3: The goal 3 of MDGs is Promoting Gender
      Equality and Women Empowerment. It is aimed at eliminating gender
      disparity in primary and secondary education by 2005 and in all levels of
      education not later than 2015. There is a stark disparity between male and
      female literacy rates. The national literacy rate of male was 71% while
      that of female was 48% in 2012-13. Provinces reported the same gender
      disparity. Punjab literacy rate in male was 71% and for females it was
      54%. In Sindh literacy rate in male was 72% and female 47%, in KPK male
      70% and females 35%, while in Balochistan male 62% and female 23%. B)
      Education for All (EFA) Commitment The EFA goals focus on early childhood
      care and education including pre-schooling, universal primary education
      and secondary education to youth, adult literacy with gender parity and
      quality of education as crosscutting thematic and programme priorities.
      EFA Review Report October 2014 outlines that despite repeated policy
      commitments, primary education in Pakistan is lagging behind in achieving
      its target of universal primary education. Currently the primary gross
      enrolment rate stands at 85.9% while Pakistan requires increasing it up to
      100% by 2015-16 to fulfil EFA goals. Of the estimated total primary school
      going 21.4 million children of ages 5-9 years, 68.5% are enrolled in
      schools, of which 8.2 million or 56% are boys and 6.5 million or 44% are
      girls. Economic Survey of Pakistan confirms that during the year 2013-14
      literacy remained much higher in urban areas than in rural areas and
      higher among males. C) Vision 2030 Vision 2030 of Planning Commission of
      Pakistan looks for an academic environment which promotes the thinking
      mind. The goal under Vision 2030 is one curriculum and one national
      examination system under state responsibility. The strategies charted out
      to achieve the goal included: (i) Increasing public expenditure on
      education and skills generation from 2.7% of GDP to 5% by 2010 and 7% by
      2015. (ii) Re-introduce the technical and vocational stream in the last
      two years of secondary schools. (iii) Gradually increase vocational and
      technical education numbers to 25-30% of all secondary enrolment by 2015
      and 50 per cent by 2030. (iv) Enhance the scale and quality of education
      in general and the scale and quality of scientific/technical education in
      Pakistan in particular. Problems: The issues lead to the comprehension of
      the problems which are faced in the development of education system and
      promotion of literacy. The study outlines seven major problems such as: 1)
      Lack of Proper Planning: Pakistan is a signatory to MDGs and EFA goals.
      However it seems that it will not be able to achieve these international
      commitments because of financial management issues and constraints to
      achieve the MDGs and EFA goals. 2) Social constraints: It is important to
      realize that the problems which hinder the provision of education are not
      just due to issues of management by government but some of them are deeply
      rooted in the social and cultural orientation of the people. Overcoming
      the latter is difficult and would require a change in attitude of the
      people, until then universal primary education is difficult to achieve. 3)
      Gender gap: Major factors that hinder enrolment rates of girls include
      poverty, cultural constraints, illiteracy of parents and parental concerns
      about safety and mobility of their daughters. Society’s emphasis on girl’s
      modesty, protection and early marriages may limit family’s willingness to
      send them to school. Enrolment of rural girls is 45% lower than that of
      urban girls; while for boys the difference is 10% only, showing that
      gender gap is an important factor. 4) Cost of education: The economic cost
      is higher in private schools, but these are located in richer settlements
      only. The paradox is that private schools are better but not everywhere
      and government schools ensure equitable access but do not provide quality
      education.
